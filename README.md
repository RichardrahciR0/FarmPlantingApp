# Farm Planting App

Welcome to the Farm Planting App â€“ a mobile tool designed to help farmers, gardeners, and orchard owners easily **plan, manage, and visualise** their farm layouts and day-to-day tasks.

This project was built as part of our final year Capstone project in collaboration with **Orefox AI Limited**. The goal was to create a user-friendly app that supports smart and sustainable agriculture, no matter your level of experience.
